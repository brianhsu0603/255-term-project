In this project, we will experiment with different types of recommender systems algorithms. By evaluating and comparing the accuracy of different models, find out the best combination of these models to create a high-precision hybrid movie recommendation system. 

The overview of our project System is shown below.

Due to the limitation of file size, we cannot upload original files to github (They are way too big). You could download all the files from this link :

#### Only movie.csv is the original one. The other files provided in this github has been corpped, feel free to use them for running and testing.
